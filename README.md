#### Known Issues ðŸš§

- Theming support is to be considered a work in progress.

#### Faq

- What is the `code/generated` folder?

  `canvas-design-system.framerfx` was created using the [@framerjs/component-importer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@framerjs/component-importer). This folder should be cleaned up at some point since many of the generated files are not used anymore. The `importer.config.json` is also a product of the `component-importer` and should also be cleaned up at some point.
